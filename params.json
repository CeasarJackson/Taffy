{"body":"I created Taffy because I was not happy with the amount of code it took to create REST API's with ColdFusion. I wanted something terse, something that used convention over configuration, and something that didn't require writing a bunch of boilerplate code. Nothing existed that filled that void, so I wrote it.\r\n\r\n### Current Version\r\nOfficially, **the latest stable version is 1.0**, which you can get from the links above or from the \"master\" branch of the GitHub repository. 1.0 was [released](https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/wiki/Releases) on August 23, 2010.\r\n\r\n**But 1.1 is imminent.** In fact, the 1.1rc1 branch is considered stable, and the only reason I haven't officially labeled 1.1 as final/released is that I'd like to write a bit more documentation first.\r\n\r\nAnd you know what? The only missing documentation is _a few_ examples. \\([You can see the to-do list here.](https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/wiki/So-you-want-to-\\(Index\\))\\) All of the functionality/api is documented and ready to go. So really, there's not much left undone. It's just that writing documentation is tedious and takes a while. Sorry about that. But, if you're _a little bit_ brave, just go ahead and use 1.1. It's got [tons of bug fixes and new features](https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/wiki/Roadmap#wiki-body), and in my opinion, is just better in many, many ways.\r\n\r\nYou can bet your belt buckle that the 1.1 branch and/or the documentation has been updated within the last month. So when anyone asks me which version to use, I say, unequivocally, without a doubt, use 1.1. Seriously. Just do it. Trust me.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nEverything is documented in the GitHub wiki.\r\n\r\n * Using Taffy 1.0? [Index of the Taffy 1.0 Documentation](https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/wiki/Taffy-1.0-Docs)\r\n * Using Taffy 1.1rc1? Everything not labeled Taffy 1.0 in the [List of Wiki Pages](https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/wiki/_pages) applies! TONS of docs!\r\n\r\n### Mailing List\r\n\r\nMany people who use Taffy subscribe to the [Taffy Users Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/taffy-users). If you're having any trouble, it's a great place to get advice or debugging help.","google":"UA-2284831-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
