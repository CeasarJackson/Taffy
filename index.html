        <section id="main_content">
          <p>I created Taffy because I was not happy with the amount of code it took to create REST API's with ColdFusion. I wanted something terse, something that used convention over configuration, and something that didn't require writing a bunch of boilerplate code. Nothing existed that filled that void, so I wrote it.</p>

<h3>Current Version</h3>

<p>Officially, <strong>the latest stable version is 1.0</strong>, which you can get from the links above or from the "master" branch of the GitHub repository. 1.0 was <a href="https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/wiki/Releases">released</a> on August 23, 2010.</p>

<p><strong>But 1.1 is imminent.</strong> In fact, the 1.1rc1 branch is considered stable, and the only reason I haven't officially labeled 1.1 as final/released is that I'd like to write a bit more documentation first.</p>

<p>And you know what? The only missing documentation is <em>a few</em> examples. (<a href="https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/wiki/So-you-want-to-(Index)">You can see the to-do list here.</a>) All of the functionality/api is documented and ready to go. So really, there's not much left undone. It's just that writing documentation is tedious and takes a while. Sorry about that. But, if you're <em>a little bit</em> brave, just go ahead and use 1.1. It's got <a href="https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/wiki/Roadmap#wiki-body">tons of bug fixes and new features</a>, and in my opinion, is just better in many, many ways.</p>

<p>You can bet your belt buckle that the 1.1 branch and/or the documentation has been updated within the last month. So when anyone asks me which version to use, I say, unequivocally, without a doubt, use 1.1. Seriously. Just do it. Trust me.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Everything is documented in the GitHub wiki.</p>
